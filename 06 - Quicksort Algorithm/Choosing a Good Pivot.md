# Choosing a Good Pivot

## Q1

Suppose we implement QuickSort so that ChoosePivot always selects the first element of the array.

What is the running time of this algorithm on an input array that is already sorted?

- Theta(n)
- Theta(n log n)
- **Theta(n^2)**

## Q2 

Suppose we run QuickSort on some input, and, magically, every recursive call chooses the median element of its subarray as its pivot.

What's the running time in this case?
