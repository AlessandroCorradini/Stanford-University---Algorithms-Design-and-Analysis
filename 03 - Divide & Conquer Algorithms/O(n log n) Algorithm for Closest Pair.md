# O(n log n) Algorithm for Closest Pair I [Advanced - Optional] - Question

## Q1

Suppose we can correctly implement the ClosestSplitPair subroutine in O(n) time.

What will be the overall running time of the ClosestPair algorithm ? (Choose the smallest upper bound that applies)

- O(n)
- **O(n log(n))**
- O(n(log(n))^2)
- O(n^2)
