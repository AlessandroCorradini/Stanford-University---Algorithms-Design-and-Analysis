# Computing Strong Components

## Q1

Only one of the following is a possible set of finishing times for the nodes 1,2,3,...,9, respectively, when the DFS-Loop subroutine is executed on the graph in the previous slide. Which is it?

- 9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1
- 1,7,4,9,6,3,8,2,5
- 1,7,9,6,8,2,5,3,4
- **7,3,1,8,2,5,9,4,6**

## Q2

How are the SCC of the original graph G and its reversal G^rev related?

- In general, they are unrelated.
- Every SCC of G is contained in an SCC of G^rev, but the converse need not hold.
- Every SCC of G^rev is contained in an SCC of G, but the converse need not hold.
- **They are exactly the same.**
