# Graph Representations

## Q1

Consider an undirected graph that has  vertices, no parallel edges, and is connected (i.e., “in one piece”).

What is the minimum and maximum number of edges that the graph could have, respectively?

- **n-1 and n(n-1)/2**
- n-1 and n^2
- n and 2^n 
- n and n^n

## Q2

How much space does an adjacency matrix require, as a function of the number n of vertices and the number m of edges?

- theta(n)
- theta(m)
- theta(m)
- **theta(n^2)**

## Q3

How much space does an adjacency list representation require, as a function of the number n of vertices and the number m of edges?

- theta(n)
- theta(m)
- **theta(m + n)**
- theta(n^2)
