# Interpretation of the 3 Cases

## Q1

Which of the following statements are true? (Check all that apply)

- **If RSP < RWS, then the amount of work is decreasing with the recursion level j.**
- **If RSP > RWS, then the amount of work is increasing with the recursion level j.**
- No conclusion can be drawn about how the amount of work varies with the recursion level j unless RSP and RWS are equal
- **If RSP and RWS are equal, then the amount of work is the same at every recursion level j.**
